# Analysis of Fandango Ratings

## Data Processing and Visualization Project

### Description

**Planning to watch a movie and wondering if you can trust online ratings and reviews? Especially when the rating company also profits from selling movie tickets, could there be a bias in their ratings?**

This project aims to analyze and visualize Fandango movie ratings to determine if there is any bias in their rating system. By examining the data, we seek to uncover any tendencies for overrating or underrating movies.
