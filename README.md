Data processing and visualization project.

## Description

**You are planning to watch a certain movie. Can you trust online movie ratings and reviews? Especially if the company that does the ratings and reviews also makes money from selling movie tickets. Do such companies have a tendency to give out over- or under-ratings?**

This project aims to analyze and visualize Fandango movie ratings to determine if there is any bias in their rating system.
